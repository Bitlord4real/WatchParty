# WatchParty
Hello, this is a small software that you run after installing Requirements by Flusk kernel, I tried to use comments in most of its parts so that you can change its parts if you want. This program is run by the Flusk library in Python. At first I tried to do this with my knowledge of Django, but in the end I made this choice to make the project lighter.

## Pay attention, the speech is for you
This little project was made on a damn boring afternoon when my nerves were messed up because of the EMSS project and I needed to watch a movie with my girlfriend. She was not near me and I wanted to watch the movie as quickly as possible for both of us, so don't be too strict about it, I don't think it will be more than a few lines of code, and naturally, due to the enmity between me and the designing, there is no effort in this field. It hasn't been done / Overall I think it would be an interesting project if I didn't come across it now I'd be happy if you could develop it, I wish you success from Deep of my heart.

# Requirements:
I tried my best to keep this damn light but you still need a powerful system/server to do streaming. All the libraries you need are in the requirements.txt file.
Needless to say, after cloning the project with the command: pip install -r requirements.txt
Both packages are installed together. (The important thing is Flask)
If you encounter an error while running the code, run the following codes in the terminal:
sudo apt-get install pkg-config libcairo2-dev
sudo apt-get install libgirepository1.0-dev
it's gonna be OK. => "INSHA ALLAH"
