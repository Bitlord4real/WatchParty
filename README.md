Hello, this is a small software that you run after installing Requirements by Flusk kernel, I tried to use comments in most of its parts so that you can change its parts if you want. This program is run by the Flusk library in Python. At first I tried to do this with my knowledge of Django, but in the end I made this choice to make the project lighter.
